# Where Should I Surf

I like to think that I'm the kind of person who can pick up at a moment's notice and go surfing*, so I built this app to help my imaginary self figure out where I should surf.

Using JavaScript and jQuery, I connected with the World Weather Online and Skyscanner APIs to find the forecast in and flight prices to the world's top surf destinations, based on user-selected dates and a Toronto departure.

The World Weather Online API key has expired, so the app is no longer functional. 

*I've never surfed in my life.
